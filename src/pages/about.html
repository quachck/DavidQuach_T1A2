              <p class="small-text">
                Just like many 17/18 year olds about to finish high school, I
                had no clue what I wanted to do with myself. 8 years later I
                found myself in a job I dreaded and decided I needed a change.
                I've always been interested in tech and knew it was where I
                wanted to be, it was only a matter of how I'd get there. After
                careful consideration of personal and financial factors I
                decided doing a bootcamp with Coder Academy was the best choice
                for me.

                After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering(Civil) I worked
                as a wastewater engineer, designing wastewater management
                systems for developments without access to sewage mains.

              <p class="small-text">
                After 2 years I moved on as a stormwater engineer while learning the basics
                of programming to see if this was what I really wanted to do. I loved
                it, designing and building something on your own from scratch was
                wonderous and fulfulling.
              </p>
              <p class="small-text">
                I then quit my job to pursue programming full time.
