              <h3>Why transition into programming?</h3>
              <p class="small-text">
                Just like many 17/18 year olds about to finish high school, I
                had no clue what I wanted to do with myself. 8 years later I
                found myself in a job I dreaded and decided I needed a change.
                I've always been interested in tech and knew it was where I
                wanted to be, it was only a matter of how I'd get there. After
                careful consideration of personal and financial factors I
                decided doing a bootcamp with Coder Academy was the best choice
                for me.

              <p class="small-text">
                After graduating with a Bachelor of Engineering(Civil) I worked as a 
                wastewater engineer, designing wastewater management systems for 
                developments without access to sewage mains. <br></br>I then worked as a 
                stormwater engineer while learning the basics of coding to see if this was 
                what I really wanted to do.
